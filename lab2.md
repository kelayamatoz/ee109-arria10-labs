### Laboratory Exercise 2: Advanced Usage of Spatial
In the last lab, we went through the basics of Spatial. In this lab, we are going to explore more advanced features of Spatial.

We will first go through the usage of controllers. Then we will use the controllers to build an app that performs matrix multiplication. After we the app, we will learn about how to improve the performance of your app by making it parallel. We will also learn about how to use the tools Spatial provides to optimize the application.
